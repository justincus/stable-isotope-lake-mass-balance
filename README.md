The Python scripts and csv files uploaded in this repository are used for the isotope mass balance calculations described in Custado, et al. (2024): Constraining the Modern Hydrological Balance of Bear Lake, Utah-Idaho: Insights from Stable Isotopes (<sup>18</sup>O and <sup>2</sup>H)

The description of each file is provided below:

- "lake_balance_functions":  Contains all the functions that are called in the other script files.
- "custado_et_al_2024_bear_lake_mass_balance_1":  Executes the individual iostopic mass balance calculations for each isotope, as described in Section 5.2.1 of the paper.
- "custado_et_al_2024_bear_lake_mass_balance_2":  Executes the isotopic mass balance calculations using the system of equations described in Section 5.2.2 of the paper.
- "custado_et_al_2024_uncertainty":  Executes combined uncertainty calculations as described in Section 5.3 of the paper.
- "custado_et_al_2024_sensitivity_sobol":  Executes the Sobol sensitivity analysis as described in Section 5.3 of the paper.
- "custado_et_al_2024_sensitivity_individual":  Executes the individual sensitivity analysis as described in Section 5.3 of the paper.
- "custado_et_al_2024_bear_lake_climate_scenarios":  Executes the calculations performed for each climate scenario as described in Section 6.3 of the paper.
- "custado_et_al_2024_plots":  Generates the plots for Figures 1, 4, 5, and 7,
- "BL_master_list.csv":  Contains the master data spreadsheet used.
- "stations_used.csv":  Contains the geographical coordinates of the hydrological stations where physical data were extracted.
